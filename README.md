Implementation of Huber-ROF model to denoise images

As final project, I implemented the Huber-ROF model based on Example 4.7 in "An introduction to continuous optimization for imaging" by Antonin Chambolle and Thomas Pock.

The program was created in Jupyter Notebook and using two different B/W images as examples.
